I've implemented some of the stuff in [Straightest Geodesics on Polyhedral Surfaces][geodesics], so now I can draw geodesics on polyhedral surfaces!

This is part of the [plan to procedurally generate a pretty map to print on a t-shirt][plan] which is being implemented [here][github-procedural-generation].
